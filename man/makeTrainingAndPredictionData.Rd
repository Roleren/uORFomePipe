\usage{
makeTrainingAndPredictionData(
  df.rfp,
  df.rna,
  organism = get("organism", mode = "character", envir = .GlobalEnv),
  biomart = get("biomart_dataset", mode = "character", envir = .GlobalEnv),
  mode = "uORF",
  max.artificial.length
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.rfp}{ORFik experiment of Ribo-seq}

\item{df.rna}{ORFik experiment of RNA-seq}

\item{organism}{scientific name of organism,
like Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, etc.}

\item{biomart}{default "ensembl", get gene symbols and GO terms for uORF genes. Will
be automaticly detected by organism name in ensembl database.
Set to NULL if you don't want to check Gene symbols and GO terms.}

\item{mode}{character, default: "uORF". alternative "aCDS". Do you want to predict
on uORFs or artificial CDS. if "aCDS" will run twice once for whole length CDS and one for
truncated CDS to validate model works for short ORFs. "CDS" is option to predict on
whole CDS.}

\item{max.artificial.length}{integer, default: 100, only applies if mode = "aCDS",
so ignore this for most people,
when creating artificial ORFs from CDS, how large should maximum ORFs be,
this number is 1/6 of maximum size of ORFs (max size 600 if artificialLength is 100)
Will sample random size from 6 to that number, if max.artificial.length is
2, you can get artificial ORFs of size (6, 9 or 12) (6, + 6 + (3x1), 6 + (3x2))}
